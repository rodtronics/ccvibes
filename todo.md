THIS TO DO LIST relates the index.html, related files, and the founding documents starting with 00_agent_readme.md

menu for resources/stats. perhaps this could be tabbed? resources is exactly that, a list of all the resources you have. stats will just tell you about what's going on.

in the log menu, have some toggles to display or not display things like successes and failures etc

scrolling down the crew members should effectivly be selecting one and then the next and next etc. because at some stage we want to be able to select a member and go into them, see their skill set and perks and what type of specialist they are

overall more space efficiency. for example, the top row is just a straight bar. I only have 25 to work with so that means 4% of my realestate is doing nothing. the title and that basic info should be on the 1st row. the menu items on the 2nd row, and the large context window starting from the 3rd row down all the way to the bottom, but the tabs under jobs for example? they're laid over the top of the top bar on row 3. and if there is info to tell the player immediately that can be laid over the bottom of the very bottom row.

some kind of way of bringing showing information about a job. maybe pressing k for exampole tells you about the option, what is costs, what you reap. in fact this screen will take up the whole of the normal content screen, and this is where you can choose criminals for the job too, and so will have ins and outs, and then modifiers that the chose criminal(s) give to the crime. one can also select the number of runs or etc. its a bit like without going into this window its quick start, but you can go into this window to make a controlled run.

a RPG system to an extent. I want to be able to manage crew more, crew can earn stars and when they get a new star they are eligible for a new skill and those skills will do things like speed up the crime, or give better outcomes, or lower heat, etc. I like the idea of the skill tree where you can choose this skill OR that one, and so any one player can't be everything amazing.

future ideas: - menu items to stop all jobs or something
future ideas: on the crew menu, if you select a crew member who is doing a job, it'll take you to that job
future ideas: can sort crew
future idea: when a new option is unlocked, there is a star or something to show that there is a new option to look at. perhaps even the branch that has a new option has a different colour to make it stand out that there is something new to look at.

bold idea - a rolling graph implement in text to show some statistics

idea : the number of players on the crew increases heat just be virtue of existing, encouraging perhaps a smaller group of more skilled crew members. when heat reaches an internal threshold (which the player doesnt know, it'll just be a gradient), someone randomly goes to jail and heat comes down a bit

upgrade the crew section to allow for selection of individual members, up and down to scroll through them, and enter will "go into" them, which will show information related to experience, and this is where you can upgrade players. the crew screen will indicate that a player can be upgraded. we will try and keep some stats on the players. and importantyl this is where we can retire players

it's already implemented in other places but tools for impatient players

in the crew menu when in a player it should show if they're in a crime and their progress

the stars we use knock out the font spacing

the [!] we put to show upgrade available should be on the right

if someone is in jail it should say so

crew menu should have a tab for visiting jail

auto repeat doesnt seem to work if crime fails
