It’s an incremental management game, but it ditches the boring linear list for a huge, hidden Tech Web. You don't just click 'Buy Mine'; you have to set up actual logistics chains. You hire specific crew members (like Chemists or Wheelmen) to scavenge raw materials, process them into illegal goods, and then distribute them. It’s got a 'Walter White' resource economy where you have to manage inputs and outputs, plus a cool mechanic where you can set 'Long Form' crimes to run overnight."
its made in pure javascript and css and html.

it is going to use a modern terminal like interface, made entirely of characters
data structure / state evolution

i’m making an idle game called crime committer. crimes tie up henchmen for real-time durations and pay out when their finishTime (timestamp) is reached.
extend the state to support:
– multiple henchmen with different names and maybe simple traits (e.g. speedMultiplier)
– more crime config fields (e.g. risk, heat, different reward types)
– update startCrime and completeCrime to handle these extra fields, but keep it data-driven, not hardcoded per crime.
in crime committer, crimes are stored with a finishTime timestamp and I call checkCrimes() periodically. i want this loop to be robust for:
– long durations (up to 24+ hours)
– the player closing the browser and coming back days later

UI (modern TUI, characters only)
- look: black field + crisp monospace, thin rules, segmented color bars
- layout: top status rail, left crew list, center ops queue, right economy, bottom log
- interaction: key-driven focus; tab switches panels; arrows select; enter opens detail
- focus: invert row + ">" caret; alerts use small colored markers
- motion: subtle bar tickers + scanline sweep; no CRT bloom

tone
- light-hearted crime sim (GTA-ish)
- no sex crimes or relatable violence; assassination maybe later

offline / time
- crimes store finishTime; on load, check if finished and grant payout
- no offline progression beyond finishTime checks
- extended crime variants: ~10x duration for ~10x (or slightly more) resources

first 5 minutes
- start with micro-crimes done by player only (no goons yet)
- initial bottleneck: player does all crimes until first hire
- unlock first goon to delegate basic jobs

crime catalog (light-hearted, non-violent)
starter micro-crimes (player-only, low heat)
- jaywalking fines hustle
- parking meter flip
- flyer scam (fake event tips)
- queue cutting (sell fast pass spots)
- sidewalk chalk ads (small biz promos)
- bottle deposit sweep

early goon-enabled (low complexity)
- package reroute (misdeliveries before return)
- scrap run (copper/parts)
- night market vending (knockoff merch)
- storage unit peek (auction preview hustle)
- sign spinner swap (ad fraud)

specialization-gated
- chemist: cleaner concentrate -> bottles
- chemist: solvent wash -> high-grade product
- wheelman: timed courier runs (risk scales with speed)
- wheelman: long-haul drop (requires vehicle)
- tech: coupon glitcher (promo code abuse)
- tech: loyalty points laundering (points -> goods)
- tech: ticket bot run (scalping)

extended variants (10x duration, 10x+ payout)
- long-haul courier contract (overnight)
- multi-day market stall (requires steady supply)
- storage unit flip (lock-in time, payout on completion)
- slow drip tip jar (low heat, steady)
