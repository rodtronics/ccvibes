this is NOT to be edited by any agent. this is for me to add my ideas into, as I am sometimes thinking of ideas fastedr than AI can implement them

in the active screen there needs to be a way to stop and sacrifice the run

at some stage we should be able to unlock "repeat" crimes. not all crimes are repeatable.

with the UI, I think we should incorporate a grid or something, there's a lot of wasted horizontal space, perhaps on the primary activities screen we could easy fit 3 or maybe even 4 buttons across. and same about when we go into the activity

Id like a bit more space between the buttons and active crimes when inside an activity.

I dont like the | in between the % and the time left.

in another version of the game the progress was like this : [==--------] and was maybe only 10 dashes wide. it said "assigned : (person) | time remaining X and then that progress bar

is there a way to indicate to the player that a crime cant be done and why? eg "not enough people" or "not enough money". at the very least the start button should be dimmed or have no rollover
