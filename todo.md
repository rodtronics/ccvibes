top few lines of the UI are largely static except for changes in some values
the top 3 lines are basically static

the text crime committer vi is on the very top line, with some border edges running into it from either eedge
the 2nd line contains some important data that makes sense at all times
and the third of 3 rows is the first instance of tabs, including activites, crew, etc
those 3 rows will largely NEVER change except to update a few values

the 4th row will contain more tabs or not, depending
in activities its most apparent that this 4th line is the top of some tabs.

its important that when a tab or window is selected, the other windows that are not selected are dimmed. I want it to always be obvious what where you are
