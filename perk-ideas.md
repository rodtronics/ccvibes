# Perk Ideas (Conceptual)

These are perk concepts that go beyond simple “+rewards / -risk” and can change how the player plans, routes, and plays.

## Information perks (change decision-making)

- **Forecast**: show expected value (EV) + worst-case for each option before committing
- **Reveal hidden gates**: show unmet unlock/visible conditions and how far off you are
- **Heat Intel**: show which systems are driving heat and estimated “attention level”
- **Route planner**: suggest shortest path to unlock a target activity/branch

## Rule-bending outcome control (player agency)

- **Reroll**: once per X minutes, reroll a weighted outcome
- **Swap**: after a bad outcome, convert it into a neutral one (reduced rewards)
- **Pity timer**: every N failures guarantees a success
- **Banked luck**: unused “good rolls” accumulate as a small permanent success-weight boost

## Economy / conversion perks (change resource meaning)

- **Liquidate**: convert one resource into another (with loss) at any time
- **Rebate**: return % of resource costs on completion (or only on success)
- **Interest**: resources generate a tiny passive trickle while you’re idle
- **Smuggling**: some costs can be paid with alternate resources (cash OR intel)

## Progression / unlock perks (change the graph)

- **Cross-branch bridge**: activities in branch A can reveal/unlock things in branch B
- **Soft unlock**: reveal locked activities earlier (can’t run them yet)
- **Gate bypass**: ignore the first unmet gate once per day
- **Chain reveals**: completing an activity automatically reveals the next “tier” in its branch

## Time / scheduling perks (change pacing)

- **Queueing**: queue the next run for an activity/option
- **Parallel slot**: +1 concurrent run globally (or per branch)
- **Cooldown bending**: cooldowns tick while jailed / while doing other runs
- **Burst mode**: first run after being idle is faster (or higher rewards)

## Crew / progression perks (change character growth)

- **Training**: some runs convert XP into role stars faster (or unlock new roles)
- **Specialist slot**: add an optional crew slot that modifies outcome weights
- **Crew insurance**: if caught, the crew avoids jail but rewards are reduced
- **Mentorship**: high-star crew boosts low-star crew XP gains in the same run

## Systems-changing “big perks” (new gameplay loops)

- **Territory**: unlock a territory-control layer; territories generate passive resources but raise heat
- **Heat as currency**: spend heat for power (bribes, intimidation, forced unlocks)
- **Blueprints**: add a crafting loop (items/tools that permanently change specific activities)
- **Factions**: unlock reputation tracks that open entirely new activity sets and endings
