this is an idle game called crime committer running on pure html/js/css

the main mechanism is iniating a crime and when it finishes you get results

There are 4 design documents for the game. I will refer to them as the founding documents.founding

01_design_philosophy.md
02_ui_spec.md
03_schema_engine.md
04_lexicon.md

These are living documents but they should be followed when making the game. if there is a discrepancy, it may be necessary to edit these documents but only do it if I ask.

IGNORE all files in the_crypt folder
