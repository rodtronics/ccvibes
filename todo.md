when differenct branches are selected, the background behind the crimes is different colour. this is defined in the branches.json

menu for resources/stats. perhaps this could be tabbed? resources is exactly that, a list of all the resources you have. stats will just tell you about what's going on.

an intro screen! first time screen. will scroll. will basically be the "how to" of the game, and player will be able to re-access it from options menu

overall more space efficiency. for example, the top row is just a straight bar. I only have 25 to work with so that means 4% of my realestate is doing nothing. the title and that basic info should be on the 1st row. the menu items on the 2nd row, and the large context window starting from the 3rd row down all the way to the bottom, but the tabs under jobs for example? they're laid over the top of the top bar on row 3. and if there is info to tell the player immediately that can be laid over the bottom of the very bottom row.

some kind of way of bringing showing information about a job. maybe pressing p for exampole tells you about the option, what is costs, what you reap. in fact this screen will take up the whole of the normal content screen, and this is where you can choose criminals for the job too, and so will have ins and outs, and then modifiers that the chose criminal(s) give to the crime. one can also select the number of runs or etc. its a bit like without going into this window its quick start, but you can go into this window to make a controlled run.

a RPG system to an extent. I want to be able to manage crew more, crew can earn stars and when they get a new star they are eligible for a new skill and those skills will do things like speed up the crime, or give better outcomes, or lower heat, etc. I like the idea of the skill tree where you can choose this skill OR that one, and so any one player can't be everything amazing.

future ideas: - menu items to stop all jobs or something
future ideas: on the crew menu, if you select a crew member who is doing a job, it'll take you to that job
