THIS TO DO LIST relates the index.html, related files, and the founding documents starting with 00_agent_readme.md

BUGS
- auto repeat doesnt seem to work if crime fails
- when on jobs/branch/options, pressing Q doesnt start a quick run
- when selecting criminals for a crime, ones that dont meet requirements shouldnt be an option. and if quick selection is chosen, it should choose a random member who meets requirements
- no Y axis labels on stats

SMALL / EASY
- in the log menu, have some toggles to display or not display things like successes and failures etc
- crew menu should have a tab for visiting jail
- in crew you can select a crew member and "go to" the active job, which will basically go to jobs/branch/option and open the job
- future ideas: can sort crew
- check for code redundancy (ongoing)

MEDIUM
- some kind of way of showing information about a job. maybe pressing k tells you about the option, what it costs, what you reap. this screen takes up the whole content area and is where you choose criminals for the job, see ins and outs, modifiers from chosen crew. can select number of runs. like a detailed launch screen vs quick start.
- overall more space efficiency. title and basic info on 1st row, menu on 2nd row, content from 3rd row down. tabs laid over top bar on row 3. immediate info on bottom row.
- future idea: when a new option is unlocked, a star or indicator shows something new. branch with new option has different colour.

LARGE / FUTURE
- a RPG system. crew earn stars, eligible for new skills (speed up crime, better outcomes, lower heat). skill tree where you choose this skill OR that one, so no crew member can be everything.
- idea: number of crew increases heat passively, encouraging smaller skilled crew. when heat hits hidden threshold, someone goes to jail and heat drops.
- illegal gambling (new branch/activity)
