THIS TO DO LIST relates the index.html, related files, and the founding documents starting with 00_agent_readme.md

my priority:
when a crime has been committed, where the runs are shown, it leaves behing a "crime committed" entry, that can be entered, and the player can see the outcome. they can then hit c to clear it from the runs, or escape to leave it. when the player is on the active runs panels and going up and down, they can clear all completed runs by pressing x.
when the crime is a multi-repeated run, there is a line under the completion bar that shows how many completed runs and how many runs left. when the player goes into that entry they can view the outcomes so far. it wont be available for clearing until the runs have been stopped.

indicators to show that a new activity or option is available

BUGS

- auto repeat doesnt seem to work if crime fails
- when on jobs/branch/options, pressing Q doesnt start a quick run
- when selecting criminals for a crime, ones that dont meet requirements shouldnt be an option. and if quick selection is chosen, it should choose a random member who meets requirements
- no Y axis labels on stats

SMALL / EASY

- in the log menu, have some toggles to display or not display things like successes and failures etc
- crew menu should have a tab for visiting jail
- in crew you can select a crew member and "go to" the active job, which will basically go to jobs/branch/option and open the job
- future ideas: can sort crew
- check for code redundancy (ongoing)

MEDIUM

- some kind of way of showing information about a job. maybe pressing k tells you about the option, what it costs, what you reap. this screen takes up the whole content area and is where you choose criminals for the job, see ins and outs, modifiers from chosen crew. can select number of runs. like a detailed launch screen vs quick start.
- overall more space efficiency. title and basic info on 1st row, menu on 2nd row, content from 3rd row down. tabs laid over top bar on row 3. immediate info on bottom row.
- future idea: when a new option is unlocked, a star or indicator shows something new. branch with new option has different colour.

LARGE / FUTURE

- a RPG system. crew earn stars, eligible for new skills (speed up crime, better outcomes, lower heat). skill tree where you choose this skill OR that one, so no crew member can be everything.
- idea: number of crew increases heat passively, encouraging smaller skilled crew. when heat hits hidden threshold, someone goes to jail and heat drops.
- illegal gambling (new branch/activity)
  right

in the box where outcomes are presented, it has [OBJECTION] before and after

early on I had an idea to employ gradients across some titles, I don't want this anymore

also the idea for hotkeys for the branches is also dead idea

a way so what when the player progresses past primordial, primordial branch disappears and any resources that are specific to primordial disappear too

when the game starts, and it defaults to the jobs menu, it should then also default to branches within the jobs menu.

I think branches also need a "visible but locked" functionality, that allows the player to move over that branch, but ALL it says is locked. that'll mean there will have to be effect that completeing a particular crime that is make branch visible but still locked. Im happy for it to be that thats the only way it can be made visble but locked, is an effect from compelteing a crime
