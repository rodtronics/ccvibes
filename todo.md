#STILL NOT WORKING: ok so we need a way when selecting a crime option to differentiate between a single run, multi run, or indefinite runs. when we are on the crime selection screen it makes sense that hitting 1 immeditaly goes into that crime, but in the option selection screen, hitting the number just selects the option and doesnt run it. we need this because we need to be able to select single run, multi, and indefinite. the hotkeys for should be g for single, m for multi and i for indefinite. if someone presses m then we should take a number input.

STILL NOT WORKING: we should then be able to press right and thats when we can select the different runs. when a run is selected we have two options, X to stop and z to stop after this run

crew management. should be a way to scroll up and down. remove button for adding 5 people at a time.

STILL NOT WORKING: I need feedback to say why a crime can't be run

when differenct branches are selected, the background behind the crimes is different colour. this is defined in the branches.json

when we are in an option and we press right it should move the selection to the active runs under that crime. when one is selected thats when X and Z are visible. and up and down should scroll through them. this will mean implementing a scrolling method, which will be used in a few places. we might need to make our own scroll bars with | and \* for example
