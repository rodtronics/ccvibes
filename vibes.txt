Crime Committer ~vibes~ is a lighthearted, GTA-ish incremental management game that blends idle timers with a data-driven, terminal-style UI. The loop is about assigning a limited crew to time-based crimes and research runs, earning cash, heat, and items while unlocking a web of tech nodes. Current build: v6.

Core loop
- Pick an activity (crime, research, or build), assign an available worker, and wait out the timer.
- Rewards can be cash, heat, inventory items, or unlocks.
- One-off activities are tracked; repeatables stay on rotation.
- Active activities continue offline and complete on return.
- Clicking a crime opens its detail view, where each worker starts a separate concurrent run.
- Multiple workers do not speed up a single run; they create parallel jobs.

UI direction (modern TUI, characters-only feel)
- Black field, crisp monospace, thin rules, segmented bars.
- Status rail shows cash, heat, active ops, and live clock.
- Tabs: Activities, Tech Web, Crew, Inventory, Log.
- Panels show crew, available crimes, economy stats, active ops, and event log.
- Rows carry short meta lines and ASCII progress bars.

Systems in the prototype
- Data-driven content from JSON (crimes, crew roles, tech nodes, research activities).
- Crew roster with roles, speed multipliers, and risk tolerance.
- Hiring pipeline with role unlock requirements and cash costs.
- Tech Web nodes unlock new crimes and roles.
- Inventory resources live alongside cash and heat.
- Event log with timestamped entries.
- Five crime branches (Drugs, Tech, Smuggling/Logistics, Fraud/Grift, Corruption/Influence).
- Each branch targets ~20 crimes plus 3-4 buildings/upgrades and has a distinct UI color.
- Some entries are not crimes (research/buildings) and run as their own one-off or repeatable ops.

Tone
- Lighthearted crime sim; avoid real-world violence.
- Focus on logistics, timing, and managing limited crew.
