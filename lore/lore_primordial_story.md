# Primordial

I am meant to be asleep.

This is one of the house rules that sits under the big ones, the ones you get yelled at for. "No hitting." "No stealing." "Don't touch the stove." Those ones have weight. Bedtime is lighter. Bedtime is a suggestion with consequences. A soft law.

The thing about a soft law is you can test it without anyone calling you a monster.

My room is dark except for the strip of light under the door. The hallway keeps breathing. Down the hall, the living room TV murmurs like it is telling secrets to itself. Every now and then there is a laugh track, and it makes me feel embarrassed for the people in it.

I keep my eyes closed on purpose.

I am learning.

If I open them too wide, I will start thinking about school tomorrow, and thinking about school makes me tired in a way that feels like losing. So instead I listen. I count the floorboards that creak when someone steps on them. I memorize the distance between my bed and the light switch, in case I ever need it fast. I track my dad's footsteps by the sound they make, heavier than my mum's, like he is wearing the day on his shoes.

He is a cop. That means he works with rules and breaks them, depending on who is watching. At the dinner table he talks about what people "get away with" like it is a kind of weather.

Tonight, he is still awake.

The house has a rhythm. When I am small enough, it feels like the house is the boss and everyone else is an employee. The kettle boils, the plates clink, the tap runs, the toilet flushes. Then the lights go off, one by one, and the whole place pretends to sleep.

I am not pretending.

I wait until the TV goes quiet. I wait until the hallway light clicks off. I wait until the silence stops sounding like a trap and starts sounding like a room.

Nothing explodes.

No sirens. No crashing ceiling. No invisible hand coming down to squash me flat for being awake.

My chest feels warm and unpleasant, like I swallowed a coin.

It is stupid, the crime I am doing. It is barely a crime. I am not taking anything. I am not hurting anyone. I am just not obeying a clock. But in my head it sits next to all the other forbidden things anyway, because it has the same shape.

Me.

Doing something anyway.

I am halfway through feeling proud when the hallway groans. A footstep. Just one. My brain turns my whole body into a statue. I hold my breath so hard it hurts.

The step stops. A door clicks softly. A drawer. The tap. Someone is getting water.

I lie there for a long time, listening to my own heart trying to snitch on me.

When the footsteps go away, I do not feel safe. I feel lucky.

Luck feels better than safe. Safer is boring.

I want to read.

This is the next problem. Wanting something is always where it starts. The wanting crawls into your head and makes a nest and then you can think about nothing else. I have a book on my bedside table, one I am allowed to have. It is a normal book, with normal words, and I hate it a little for being normal.

The light in my room is a trap. If I turn it on, it shines through the gap under the door like a confession. The grown-ups do not need to see me to know. They see the light and they will come and there will be questions, and then there will be the punishment that is not called punishment.

Bed.

In my head, bed is a cell. In their mouths, bed is for my own good. Same architecture. Different branding.

I need light that does not announce itself.

I know where my dad keeps a torch.

The knowledge sits in my head like a dare.

I get out of bed so slowly the sheets barely move. The carpet is cold. It wakes up my feet. I put my hand on the wall to steady myself, like I am already a professional.

The hallway is darker than my room. In my room the darkness belongs to me. Out here it belongs to the house.

I pad along the edge, avoiding the loud floorboard. I have been practicing without knowing I am practicing. It is the same as learning a video game map. You die a few times. Then you stop dying.

The kitchen is a different country at night. During the day it is a place where people yell at you for crumbs. At night it becomes a museum. Everything is in its place. The fridge hums. The clock on the microwave shows bright numbers that feel like they are watching me.

I know the torch is in the cupboard with the baking stuff. My mum keeps it there because she thinks baking is wholesome and torches are useful. It makes sense in her head. In my head, it is camouflage.

I crouch. I put my fingertips on the cupboard handle.

The handle is colder than it should be. My fingers go numb with nerves.

I pull.

The cupboard makes a sound. Not loud. Not even a squeak. Just a small complaint, like the house clearing its throat.

I freeze again. I wait. I listen for footsteps, for my name, for the end of everything.

Nothing.

I open it the rest of the way. Inside is a bag of flour, a tin of cocoa, a stack of plastic containers, and the torch sitting there like it has been waiting.

It is cheap. It is plastic. It is not a weapon. It is not a key. It is just a tool that makes the dark negotiable.

I take it anyway.

This is the first real theft. It is small enough to pretend it does not count, but I can feel my brain logging it. Taking. Taking. Taking.

I close the cupboard as gently as I can. It makes the same tiny complaint. I hate it. I hate that the house talks back.

I am halfway down the hallway when my dad coughs.

The sound is huge. It fills the space. It turns my blood to ice. I stop so fast my toes curl into the carpet. The torch is in my hand and suddenly it feels like it is glowing even though it is not switched on.

Another cough. A chair shifts. A low murmur of the TV again, like it never stopped, like the silence was a lie.

He does not come out.

I keep moving. Slow. Quiet. Not running, because running is what guilty people do in movies. I am not a movie. I am just a kid going back to bed.

In my room I slide under the covers like I am returning to the scene of the crime to plant evidence. My hands are shaking. I tuck the torch next to my pillow so it does not roll and clack against the wall. I wait again, listening to make sure the world is still in the same arrangement as it was a minute ago.

It is.

I breathe.

Then I feel stupid for being scared. Then I feel stupid for feeling stupid. It is a loop.

The torch clicks on with a soft snap.

Under the blanket, the light turns my world into a small private stage. The fabric glows faintly. The air smells like laundry detergent and my own breath. My heart calms down because now I can see my hands. It is amazing how quickly the brain forgives you for being afraid if you give it something pretty.

I open my book.

The page is warm. The words sit there like they have always been mine.

I read fast at first, like I am racing someone. The sentences run through my head and I barely taste them. I keep glancing toward the bedroom door even though I cannot see it from under the blanket. It does not matter. I know where it is, like a predator knows where the edge of the forest is.

At some point I stop racing and start reading.

The reading feels like winning. It feels like taking something without hands.

That is when I hear the hallway again.

A light switch clicks.

The strip of brightness under my door turns into a blade.

I kill the torch and flatten myself. I pull the blanket up around my face. I make my eyes go slack. I practice sleep the way I practiced walking silently: like a craft.

The door handle turns slightly, just enough to test it. I can picture my mum's hand there, tired fingers, checking me without wanting to deal with me.

She does not open the door.

I am a better liar than she is a checker. Or maybe she just wants me to be asleep so badly she is willing to believe it.

The light goes off again.

I lie in the dark for a long time, not moving, listening to the house settle, listening to my own fear leak out of me in slow waves.

When I finally click the torch on again, the light feels dirtier. Like I am doing something worse than reading.

I want something else now.

This is the part nobody tells you about rules. Breaking one rule makes the next one easier to imagine. It is like your brain gets a new menu item. "Staying up late" sits there, glowing. "Stealing a torch" sits next to it. There is room for more.

My dad has books.

He has a shelf in the other room, the room where I am not meant to go unless I am asked. The room smells like aftershave and paper and the weird metallic scent that comes off his belt when he hangs it up. The belt is not a normal belt. It has weight. It has responsibility. It has things clipped to it that are not for me.

I have seen one of the books on that shelf. It is about crime.

Not a story about criminals with cool hair and fast cars. Not a comic. Not a thing meant to entertain me.

A real book. The kind with a serious cover. The kind adults keep because it makes them feel competent.

It feels unfair that he gets to keep it. Like having the answers to a test.

I just know that the book exists, and that my dad, of all people, owns it.

If he can read about crime, why can't I?

If he can keep it in his house, why can't I borrow it?

Borrow is the word my brain offers me, generous and clean. Steal is the word the house would use.

I wait until the TV finally dies. I wait until the sink runs. I wait until the toilet flushes. I wait until the rhythm tells me the grown-ups have retired to their own rooms, their own soft laws.

Then I go.

The other room feels bigger at night. The shadows make the corners deeper. The furniture looks like it is pretending to be innocent. My dad's jacket hangs over a chair like a person slumped there. I almost whisper sorry to it, just in case it wakes up.

The bookshelf is against the wall. I step toward it and my torch feels heavier in my hand, like it knows what I am about to do with it.

I do not switch the torch on. I do this by memory, by feel. I find the spine I remember, thick and stiff, the title in block letters I cannot fully read from where I stand during the day. My fingers slide along it. Paper dust coats my fingertips.

I pull.

The book comes out with a little sigh, like it is relieved to be chosen.

For a second I just hold it. It is heavier than my school books. It feels like it has authority in it. Like holding it makes me older.

I should put it back.

I do not.

I carry it to my room like a stolen organ.

Under the blanket, the torch makes the cover glow. The title is plain. The pictures inside are black and white. The words are not hard, but the idea behind them is hard.

Crime is not magic in this book. It is a list of habits. It is patterns. It is people doing the same stupid things because they want something badly enough to risk being caught.

My dad has underlined parts. There are notes in the margin in his handwriting. His writing is the writing of someone who gets to tell other people what happened. There is something disgusting about how calm it looks.

I read about evidence. I read about motive. I read about opportunity.

I read about how people get found.

It is not meant to help me. It helps me anyway.

That is when I get the feeling again. The coin warmth in my chest. The feeling that I have stepped into a room I was not invited into and nobody has stopped me.

Crime is bad. I know this. My dad says it like it is an illness, like criminals are a different species that you can spot from a distance if you have training.

But crime is also, quietly, cool.

Not cool like a superhero. Cool like a secret. Cool like a trick that works. Cool like understanding the rules so well you can touch the edges of them without burning your hand.

I am not thinking about prisons. I am thinking about doors. I am thinking about lights. I am thinking about how the house creaks and how I can move around the creaks like they are mines.

I am thinking about how the world is made of systems, even the small world of my hallway and my kitchen.

I am thinking about how systems can be studied.

At some point my eyes start to sting. The torch gets hot. The blanket air gets thin. I should stop.

I turn one more page anyway.

When I finally switch the torch off and close my eyes, the darkness does not feel like sleep anymore. It feels like a place I can work in.

I fall asleep with the book hidden under my mattress.

In the morning, nobody says anything.

The ceiling is still up there.

Nobody died.

I eat cereal and listen to my dad talk about his day, and I keep my face normal, and I feel sick with relief.

Then I feel worse when I realize I want to do it again. Not because I hate rules. Not because I love being bad.

Because it works.
