# Primordial

The house is a system. During the day, the system works for the adults. They walk loud. They open doors without checking the hinges. They turn lights on like they own the electricity.

You are small. You do not own anything. You are a guest in the system, subject to its schedule.

Bedtime is the firewall. It separates the day, where you are managed, from the night, where you do not exist.

But tonight you are awake.

You lie in the dark and listen to the house cool down. The pipes tick. The fridge shudders. The TV in the living room stops murmuring. The heavy footsteps of your father—the ones that sound like boots even when he is barefoot—fade into the master bedroom.

Silence.

This is the first lesson. If you do not make a sound, and they do not see you, the rules cannot touch you. You are invisible.

You sit up. The air is cold. The floor is a map of hazards. You know which board screams outside your door. You know the carpet in the hall slides if you step on it wrong.

You need a tool.

The dark is too thick. You cannot navigate the system if you cannot see the variables. You know where the torch is. It lives in the chaotic drawer in the kitchen, buried under dead batteries and takeaway menus.

You move.

The hallway feels longer than it does in the day. It feels like a throat. You press your back against the wall. You breathe shallow, through your nose. You are not playing a game. Games have safety nets. This has consequences. If you are caught, you are returned to the cell. You lose the night.

You reach the kitchen. The lino is freezing. The pilot light on the stove watches you like a red eye.

You open the drawer. It sticks. You stop. You wait. You count to ten. The house does not wake up. You pull it harder, slow, steady tension. It slides open.

You find the plastic handle. You test the switch. A beam of yellow light hits the floor.

It is ugly light. Weak, battery-dying light. But it is yours.

You retreat. You do not run. Running is for panic. You walk with purpose. Back to the room. Back to the bunker.

Under the quilt, the air gets hot and smells of dust. You turn the torch on. You open your book. It is a story about a dog. It is boring. But reading it now, in the stolen time, with the stolen light, makes it feel illicit. You are consuming content you are not authorized for.

But the dog book is not enough. You want to know how the house works. You want to know why your father looks at the front door like it is a breach point.

You know he brings work home. He leaves it on the desk in the study. The room that smells of stale tobacco and printer toner.

You go back out.

The study door is ajar. You push it with one finger. The hinges whine. You freeze. You wait for the shout. It does not come.

You shine the torch on the desk. Papers. Forms. A heavy black book with silver letters. 'Criminal Procedure and Evidence'.

It looks dry. It looks like homework.

You take it.

Back under the covers, you open the heavy book. The text is small. There are no pictures. It talks about 'probable cause' and 'chain of custody'. It talks about how to catch people who break rules.

You read a paragraph about footprints. You read a paragraph about fingerprints.

You realize something that makes your stomach turn over.

The police do not catch criminals because they are magic. They catch them because criminals are sloppy. Criminals leave traces. Criminals get lazy. Criminals think they are smarter than the system.

Your father is a mechanic of this system. He fixes the breaks.

You look at your own hands in the yellow torchlight. You look at the book. You are holding the manual for the enemy team.

If you read this, you will know what they look for. If you know what they look for, you can ensure it is not there.

You are not scared anymore. You are studying.

You fall asleep with the manual under your pillow. In the morning, you put it back before the coffee machine starts hissing.

Your father looks at you at breakfast. He looks tired. He does not know you have his book in your head.

You eat your toast. You look at the kitchen drawer. You look at the floorboards.

The house is still a system. But now you have the blueprints.
