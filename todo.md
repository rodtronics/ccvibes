THIS TO DO LIST relates the index.html, related files, and the founding documents starting with 00_agent_readme.md

BUGS

- auto repeat doesnt seem to work if crime fails (stopPolicy not enforced in engine)
- when selecting criminals for a crime, ones that dont meet requirements shouldnt be an option. and if quick selection is chosen, it should choose a random member who meets requirements
- no Y axis labels on stats
- multi-run status line should be directly under progress bar (currently in results header)

SMALL / EASY

- indicators to show that a new activity or option is available
- in the log menu, have some toggles to display or not display things like successes and failures etc
- crew menu should have a tab for visiting jail
- in crew you can select a crew member and "go to" the active job, which will basically go to jobs/branch/option and open the job
- crew sorting options
- check for code redundancy (ongoing)

- when a new option is unlocked, a star or indicator shows something new. branch with new option has different colour.

LARGE / FUTURE

- RPG system: crew earn XP/stars, eligible for new skills (speed up crime, better outcomes, lower heat). skill tree where you choose this skill OR that one, so no crew member can be everything.
- number of crew increases heat passively, encouraging smaller skilled crew. when heat hits hidden threshold, someone goes to jail and heat drops.
- illegal gambling (new branch/activity)
- branches need "visible but locked" functionality - player can see it but can't access. unlock via crime completion effects.
- one-time options: after successful completion, option disappears from list (for intel gathering, etc)
- resource obsolescence: flag resources as "redundant" with unhide toggle to view them without cluttering main list
- "what happened while you were away" summary when reloading game after offline time
- resources screen improvements: filters at top, better spacing/layout, sorting options
- idle game progression: large numbers with formatting (K, M, B, etc)
- primordial branch phase-out: when player progresses past primordial era, branch and its specific resources disappear
- default focus on game start: jobs menu should default to branches view (not activity list)

random bug - the bloom filter was a diff size to the rest of the game.
when we go to dos mode, the bloom filter layer is visible

in dos - you can try to delete cc.exe but itll say no permission. you can try sudo and itll ask password but its a trick there is no password

add a dos command "contact" that shares wfproductionsnz@gmail.com

dos: doesnt need to ask for help to show another page when a new command is used unless the that command itself is more than a page long

important UI decision. when we are in options and we push right into having active runs selected, we have it so the left hand window shows the content we want to see while selecting the item on the right.. we NEED to lower the header of the left hand window, it gives the left hand window less creedence and kinda of shows to the player than the right hand window is still the window we have selected and is what's driving whwats going on, and that the left hand stuf is _just_ info.. otherwise this is going to get confusing. it has to be OBVIOUS FUCKING OBIOVUS that the selected window is the right hand window, and that theleft hand window has now turned into a slave.

MODALs can we maybe get a margins sometnig
